  "text": "Study of Monsoon Onset over Kerala during 2024 using satellite observations Peak of TPW: Region: 50 E:65 E 16 May 2024 0 N:10 N Prediction of Onset: 03 June 2024 (after 18 days from peak of TPW, 4 days) Pentad Wind at 850 hPa during pre-monsoon month of 2024 The wind reversal over equator yet to occur and the westerly wind got stronger after the peak TPW achieved. Conclusion A peak of TPW over the Arabian Sea (50 E:65 E; 0 N:10 N) is occurred 18 days prior to Onset at Kerala. MJO start forming at the same time over equatorial Indian Ocean. The monsoon wind (wind reversal over equator and strong westerly wind) over Arabian Sea into Indian landmass started after the peak of TPW observed. The present analysis lead to the conclusion that the Onset may occurred on 03 June 2024 with a error of 4 days. We may like to update our prediction if any cyclonic condition occur over Bay of Bengal.",
